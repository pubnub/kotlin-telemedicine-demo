# PubNub Telemedicine App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pubnub/kotlin-telemedicine-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pubnub/kotlin-telemedicine-demo)

The DrChat app demonstrates how to build a feature-rich telemedicine chat application using [PubNub Chat](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/chat/quickstart) and [PubNub Kotlin SDK](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/kotlin). Learn how to add private messaging for patients and doctors and group messaging for doctors to talk about cases. Learn how to build advanced features like online/offline presence indicators, typing indicators, read receipts, and file upload. You can download the project to run on your local machine, and explore the code to see how we built it.

For this project we suggest to create two **Pixel 2** devices with **Android Q** (API 29) system.

1. Open **AVD Manager** - select **Tools / AVD Manager**.
   ![Open AVD](screenshot/avd-open.png)
   
1. Click **Create Virtual Deviceâ€¦**, at the bottom of the AVD Manager dialog.
   ![AVD](screenshot/avd-dialog.png)

1. On **Hardware Profile** page please select **Phone** category, **Pixel 2** hardware, and then 
   click **Next**.
   ![AVD Hardware Profile](screenshot/avd-hardware.png)

1. Select **Android Q** system image, then click **Next**. If you see **Download** next to the 
   system image, you need to click it to download the system image. You must be connected to the 
   internet to download it.
